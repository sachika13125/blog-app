This is my 3rd portofolio project, and it is a news application. 
It has four pages such as landing page, feeds page, 
favorites page and login page.
This project showcases how to build a dynamic Single-Page web Application 
with ES6+ JavaScript using the React.js.

"News API", which is one of the public API, is used to get articles.
